========

panyam forked and fixed it to adapt to cpp standards (iostream.h>iostream, using std namespace, so on) : 
so it is now compilable with newer gcc

this version is forked at this point, additionally : 
<ul>
<li>every subproject adopts <b>utf-8 support</b> for parsed source code (just started, it is not ready)</li>
<li>ast generator : merge multiple level hierarchy ASTClass-es (working)</li>
</ul>
